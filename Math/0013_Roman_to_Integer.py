Problem: 13. Roman to Integer

Difficulty: Easy

Topic:
- Math
- String
- Hash Table

Approach:
Store the value of each Roman numeral in a dictionary.

Traverse the string from left to right.

For each symbol:
- If its value is smaller than the value of the next symbol,
  subtract it from the answer.
- Otherwise, add it to the answer.

The subtraction cases naturally handle Roman numerals such as
IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, and CM.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
